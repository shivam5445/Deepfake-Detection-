# Project Summary:

This project implements a web application using Flask and React to detect whether an image is real or fake. The backend, developed in Flask, hosts a deep learning model trained for this purpose. The model is capable of analyzing images and providing a percentage indicating how real the image appears to be. The frontend, built with React, facilitates user interaction by allowing them to upload images for analysis
